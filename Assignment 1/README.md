ABOUT:

I can calculate the area and circumference of a circle,
area and perimeter of a rectangle, and the area, perimeter and 
height of a triangle. 

WHAT I DID:

To calculate these shapes, I created four classes. 
My four classes were named Triangle, Rectangle, Circle, and 
Main. 

In my Circle class, I created an attribute called radius which 
was of type double. I created the attribute
to calculate a circle's area.  
We also had a constructor
that took in a value of type double from the driver class and set 
it equal to my radius value. After creating my constructor, I 
also created two methods called area and circumference. These 
methods both took in no parameters and used my radius value to 
calculate the area and circumference of a circle using their 
respected formula. 

My Triangle and Rectangle classes worked the same. 
My Triangle class had three attributes of type double which 
were called side 1, side 2, and side 3. My constructor took in three 
parameters and set them equal to my three attributes. Then I
created three methods that calculated the height, area, and
parameter of a triangle using their respected formulas and the
three attributes. I also added a toString method which printed
out the sides of the triangle and the area and parameter. 

My Rectangle class had two attributes of type double which 
were called height and width. My constructor took in two 
parameters of type double and set them equal to my two attributes.
Then I created two methods, called area and perimeter, that took my two 
attributes and calculated the area and perimeter of a Rectangle by 
using its respected formula. 

In my driver class, called main, I printed out the area and 
circumference of all circles with a radius of 1 through 10.
I also printed out all rectangles with a width of 1 through 3 and
a height of 1 through 3. 
Lastly, I printed out the area and perimeter of a Triangle with 
sides 18x30x24 and 3x4x5. 
I was able to achieve this by creating 2 Triangle objects, a Circle 
object, and a Rectangle object.
For my Triangle objects, I simply passed in the sides 18,30, and 24 in 
my first Triangle object and 3,4,5 in my second Triangle object. 
For my Circle object, I created a for loop and passed in my 
incremented value as my radius.
For my Rectangle object, I created a nested for loop, and pass 
in both of my incremented values in my second for loop. 

GOAL:
The goal of this assignment was to practice object-oriented 
programming. I was able to understand the purpose that OOP
has when writing code. Not only could I identify my mistakes 
easily, but I was also able to call on my object any time I needed 
to calculate the area of a Triangle without retyping the 
formulas.
